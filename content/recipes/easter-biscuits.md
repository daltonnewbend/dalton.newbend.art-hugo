# easter biscuits

#### ingredients
	2.5  cups    soft wheat self-rising flour
	1    tsp     baking powder
	1/4  tsp     salt
	1/4  tsp     black pepper
	1    tsp     sugar
	1/4  cup     butter (half a stick)
	1/2  cup     whole milk
	1/2  cup     sour cream, buttermilk, or greek yogurt


#### instructions
- mix dry ingredients in a bowl
- kneed in softened butter, you're making biscuits!
- mix milk and sour in separate cup, save a little
- stir with wooden paddle
- drop 8-12 biscuits on parchment-lined pan, wash with leftover milk
- bake for 12-15 minutes, turn halfway

#### notes
great as [[sausage biscuits]], [[biscuits & gravy]], or just served as a side with something like [joshua's favorite chicken](joshua's%20favorite%20chicken.md) or [veggie stew](veggie%20stew.md).
you can also add 3/4 cup of chopped kielbasa with 3/4 cup of gouda for sausage & gouda biscuits.
