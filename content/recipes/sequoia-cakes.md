##### ingredients
	2    cups   old fashioned oats
	2    cups   milk
	3           eggs (separated)
	1-3  tbs    sugar (egg whites)
	1/2  cup    all purpose flour
	1/4  cup    maple syrup or sugar
	opt extras  cinnamon, nutmeg, berries, etc.

#### instructions
- combine oats with milk, yolks, flour, sugar, and extras
- set aside
- whisk egg whites with sugar until forming mild peaks
- slowly fold in oat mixture into egg whites
- cook on a large oiled skillet or pan around 325 or medium heat
- these take a bit longer to cook in the middle, but the outside is unlikely to become 'overdone'
