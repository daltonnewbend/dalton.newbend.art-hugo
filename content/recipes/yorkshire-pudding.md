ingredients
	4            eggs
	200g         flour
	3/4  cup     milk
	1/2  cup     drippings &/or oil
	--------------------------
	*optionals*
	1/2  tsp     salt
	1/2  tsp     black pepper

#### instructions
- pour drippings in muffin-tin, set in oven until sizzling
- mix dry ingredients, then wet
- pull pan from oven and pour batter into sizzling oil
- bake 20-30 minutes until golden brown

*best if using seasoned drippings & served hot*
[joshua's favorite chicken](joshua's%20favorite%20chicken.md) usually leaves good drippings for this
also try with drippings from [pulled pork](pulled%20pork.md) or skim some fat from the [[pork stock]]
