Shrines are an effort to explore spirituality through the lens of craft. Constructed to honor the makers of all things involved in the shrine, from the trees who grew the lumber, to the artisan who wove the bowl, viewers are offered a moment of silence with the objects and materials considered.
To build the shrines I create collections of items akin to an arsenal of tools. When an installation materializes through these objects, they work like moments and movements in musical works. Like an overture, various phrases, or images, are repeated in later movements or compositions. Working with primarily found objects, I'm attracted to the history, life, and sexuality objects can possess.
